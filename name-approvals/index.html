          Naming a child is a huge responsibility, but it's one that more and
          more parents are failing to take seriously. A child's name does not
          imbue power or uniqueness, but it is the place from which all relationships
          necessarily begin. From friends and colleagues to total strangers, a
          name is the starting point for the collaborative human experience,
          so you better not mess it up...

          In an effort to ensure names are being chosen that work well — both for
          the child and socienty at large — we've created this handy tool to
          help identify problematic choices.
